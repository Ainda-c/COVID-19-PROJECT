# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
- This project builds a data analysis and reporting tool to track global COVID-19 trends, analyzing cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries (e.g., USA, India, Brazil, Germany, UK). It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualizations (line charts, bar charts, choropleth maps), and a report in Jupyter Notebook.

objectives:
  - Import and clean global COVID-19 data from owid-covid-data.csv.
  - Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
  - Compare metrics across selected countries (e.g., USA, India, Brazil, Germany, UK).
  - Visualize trends using line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, and choropleth maps.
  - Summarize findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report.

Tools and libraries:
  1. pandas - Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
  2. matplotlib - Plotting line and bar charts.
  3. seaborn - Enhanced visualizations and heatmaps.
  4. plotly.express - Interactive choropleth maps.
  5. jupyter - Notebook environment for analysis and reporting.

How to run/view the project:
1. Clone the Repository - https://github.com/Ainda-c/COVID-19-PROJECT.git
2. Open COVID19.ipynb file and run all cells to see analysis and visuals on github environment

 Key Insights:
- The USA and India led in total cases, with peaks during the Delta wave (mid-2021).
- Brazil’s death rate (~2.5%) was higher than Germany’s (~1.2%), suggesting healthcare differences.
- The UK reached >70% vaccination by mid-2022, while India scaled up later.
- Case spikes often aligned with new variants or relaxed restrictions.
- Choropleth maps show high case density in North America and Europe.
