# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
- This project builds a data analysis and reporting tool to track global COVID-19 trends, analyzing cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries (e.g., USA, India, Brazil, Germany, UK). It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualizations (line charts, bar charts, choropleth maps), and a report in Jupyter Notebook.

objectives:
  - Import and clean global COVID-19 data from owid-covid-data.csv.
  - Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
  - Compare metrics across selected countries (e.g., USA, India, Brazil, Germany, UK).
  - Visualize trends using line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, and choropleth maps.
  - Summarize findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report.

Tools and libraries:
  1. pandas - Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
  2. matplotlib - Plotting line and bar charts.
  3. seaborn - Enhanced visualizations and heatmaps.
  4. plotly.express - Interactive choropleth maps.
  5. jupyter - Notebook environment for analysis and reporting.
